- Apply CNN and LSTM models to perform action recognition and image captioning.
- Integrate the trained models with a frontend so the application runs from the browser.
- Expose the model via a REST API (or similar) for frontend ↔ model communication.
- Host the application code on GitHub and ensure the frontend can be executed from the repository link.
- Include several sample images in the repo that demonstrate action recognition and image annotation.
- Specify the dataset used and include setup/run instructions in the repository README.
- Submit the GitHub repository link for evaluation.
- Be prepared to explain the full process during an interview; ask questions during lectures if needed.
